# 🚀 Meeting Debrief: Supercharging Payroll with the New OCR Automation Tool

**Objective:** This session served as a pivotal demonstration of the new OCR/AI tool designed to digitize manual timecard entry. The primary goals were to showcase its current capabilities and, more importantly, to gather critical feedback from the payroll team to guide the next phase of development into a truly indispensable workflow solution.

### 🤖 The OCR/AI Tool in Action: From PDF to Actionable Data

Lawrence presented a live demonstration of the tool's core functionality. The workflow showcased a powerful combination of OCR (Optical Character Recognition) and AI to intelligently process timecard documents.

*   **Effortless Ingestion:** The process begins with a simple PDF upload. Future enhancements could include automated ingestion from a dedicated email inbox or fax line.
*   **Intelligent Extraction:** The tool scans the document and extracts key data points, including employee names, dates, and individual time punches (in/out for lunch, in/out for the day).
*   **Automated Validation & Flagging:** A standout feature was the system's ability to automatically perform calculations and visually flag discrepancies.
    > "Is that why they're red, Lawrence? Is that like to flag your attention?"
    
    Anytime the AI's calculated hours did not match the total hours written on the timecard, the fields were highlighted in **red**, immediately drawing the user's attention to potential errors that require manual review. This transforms the tool from a simple data entry assistant into a proactive validation engine.

### 🔗 The "Missing Link": Critical Data from Bullhorn

The discussion quickly zeroed in on a fundamental requirement: the OCR data, while valuable, is incomplete without critical context from Bullhorn. To eliminate the need for users to constantly switch between systems, the tool must become a unified validation dashboard.

The payroll team identified several **must-have** data points that need to be pulled from Bullhorn and displayed alongside the OCR'd timecard information:

*   **🔑 Assignment ID:** This was identified as the **absolute primary key**. All hours must be submitted against a specific Assignment ID, making it the most critical piece of information for matching a timecard to a record in Bullhorn.
*   **🏢 Client / Customer ID Number:** Essential for correctly identifying the client, especially for national VMS accounts where client names can be generic or repetitive across different locations.
*   **💵 Pay Rate:** Crucial for applying complex overtime rules. As Karla noted, rules in Nevada are dependent on whether an employee earns more or less than $18/hour. Displaying the pay rate directly in the tool is non-negotiable.
*   **🗓️ Week Start/End Dates:** Needed to validate that the timecard's period aligns with the assignment's active dates.

### 🧠 Beyond the Numbers: Handling Complex Business Rules

It became evident that a simple hours calculator is not enough. The tool must eventually incorporate a sophisticated rules engine to be truly effective.

*   **A Multi-Layered Hierarchy:** The team confirmed that payroll rules are governed by a complex hierarchy that includes **Client-specific**, **State**, **County**, and even **City**-level mandates.
*   **Specialized Pay Codes:** Erin highlighted another layer of complexity: the need for the tool to recognize and correctly categorize various **pay codes** (e.g., holiday, sick time, vacation) that can be captured on a timecard.

### ⚡ The Path Forward: Direct SQL Integration for Maximum Power

A pivotal technical decision was made during the call. Instead of navigating the potential limitations of the Bullhorn API, the team opted for a more direct and powerful approach.

> **Lawrence:** "If I have access to... the mirror database, it's gonna be rather quick. I'm gonna shock you guys."

By connecting directly to the **mirrored SQL database**, Lawrence gains greater flexibility, faster query speeds, and unrestricted access to the data tables. This will significantly accelerate the integration process and allow for the creation of more complex and reliable matching logic.

### ✅ Action Plan & Next Steps

To maintain momentum, the following action items were agreed upon, with a follow-up call planned for the next week to review progress.

| Action Item | Owner(s) | Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **🎨 Provide UI Feedback & Mockups** | Payroll Team | Send sketches, screenshots, or detailed descriptions of the ideal user interface. Focus on the layout of Bullhorn data, required buttons, and overall workflow. |
| **🔓 Grant Database Access** | Yasser | Provide Lawrence with the necessary credentials and connection information for the Bullhorn SQL mirror database. |
| **🛠️ Develop Integration Queries** | Lawrence | Once access is granted, begin developing the SQL queries needed to match OCR'd data to Bullhorn records and pull the critical fields (Assignment ID, Pay Rate, etc.). |
| **📚 Compile Master Business Rules** | Maria | Work with Jen Rivas to obtain the master document of all client, state, and local payroll rules. This will be essential for a future development phase. |
| **🗓️ Schedule Follow-up Meeting** | David | Organize the next follow-up call to review Lawrence's progress on the integration and discuss the UI feedback from the payroll team. |
| **Keep being cool** | Daniel | Will be cool. |
