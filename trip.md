### **Phase 3: Fall Foliage & Wine Country**
* **Day 4: Into the Berkshires**
    * **The Plan:** Head west into the Berkshire Mountains. Thanks to the higher elevation, the leaves here will be showing their vibrant reds and oranges earlier in the season. Visit the Norman Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge.

* **Day 6: Central New York & The Finger Lakes**
    * **The Plan:** Cross into New York and drive through the Mohawk Valley to the Finger Lakes region, famous for its deep blue lakes and autumn wine harvests.
    * **The Drive:** ~3.5 to 4 hours.
    * **Where to Stay:** *1795 Acorn Inn* (Canandaigua) or *Bella Rose B&B*. Check in for a 2-night stay.

    * **The Plan:** Finish your westward trek. Arrive at Niagara Falls and check into your final B&B.
    * **The Drive:** ~2.5 hours.
    * **Where to Stay:** *Butler House Bed & Breakfast* (Niagara Falls, NY). Walkable to the state park. Check in for a 6-night stay to round out the 2 weeks.

        * Take the **Maid of the Mist** boat tour.
        * Get up close to the Bridal Veil Falls at the **Cave of the Winds**.
        * Take a day trip 45 minutes south to **Letchworth State Park** (the "Grand Canyon of the East") for spectacular leaf-peeping.
        * Cross into Canada (bring your passport!) for a day trip to the charming town of **Niagara-on-the-Lake**.
* **Day 14: Fly Home to Albuquerque**
    * **The Plan:** Drive to **Buffalo Niagara International Airport (BUF)**, drop off your rental car, and catch your flight home to ABQ. BUF is a small, easy-to-navigate airport and your absolute best option for flying out of the Niagara region.
